# bbcmp.py - BootStrap Basic Compiler 
# command line: bbcmp.py sdsys sfp binfp
# eg sudo python3 bbcmp.py /usr/local/sdsys GPL.BP/BBPROC GPL.BP.OUT/BBPROC
# note - need root privilege to 
# sdsys - path to sdsys, most likely "/usr/local/sdsys"
# sfp -   directory and file name of source, appended to sdsys to resolve full path
#         ie) GPL.BP/BCOMP for BCOMP source
# binfn - directory and file name of pcode object file, appended to sdsys to resolve full path
#         ie) GPL.BP.OUT/BCOMP.OUT
# If $catlog directive found in source  bbcmp will also write the pcode object file to the global catalog file
#         ie) for BCOMP,  $catalog $BCOMP is found in source.  bbcmp will write the pcode object file to
#         sdsys/gcat/$BCOMP
#        
# Used for initial install only!
# The intent is to create a stripped down basic compiler to generate the
# pcode files to get the system up and running.
#
#   - conditional compile $ifdef $ifndef - not supported
#   - EQUATE - not supported (simple version support could be added, treat like $define)
#   - DEFFUN - not supported at this time, tbd
#   - Nested $include files - not supported
#   - voc $BASIC.OPTIONS - not supported
#   - ONLY compiler directives $DEFINE and $INCLUDE are supported
#   - See "handlers for intrinsic functions" to determine if  a function is supported or not
#   - OBJECTS - not supported
#   - no $MODE compiler directives (running as native qm)
#
# bbcmp.py maybe slow and ungly, but the intended use is to do away with "binary" files
#   in the GitHub repository........
#
# The assumption is we need at a minimum:
# CPROC LOGIN BASIC BCOMP PTERM CATALOG
# Along with certain of the recursive programs - tbd
#   --or--
# Create a stripped down command processor (see APISRVR)
# That basically calls BCOMP to compile 
# CPROC LOGIN BASIC BCOMP PTERM CATALOG
# Along with certain of the recursive programs - tbd
# Requires a special startup of SD that does not load the pcode file (does not exist yet)
#   sudo sd -b for bootstrap ?????
#
# Notes - using dictionarys to replace btree
#       - lists for dynamic arrays
#       - object created as bytearray
#       - max object file CODE_SIZE = 128000 should be enough for what we need to do
#       - using python array module to speed up integer arrays
#
# It appears BCOMP processes include files recursively, allowing a 10 deep layer.
#  This most likely is due to program size restrictions on earlier versions of QM or
#   Give the abiltiy to produce program listings with the include files broken out?
# Regardless, plan where is to:
# Pass 1:
#   Create a program source file (python list) with all include files "included"
#   bbcmp DOES NOT support nested includes.  I don't need it for the programs we plan process!
#   This pass also re joins lines with the continuation line marker (~)
#   This pass also rejects source with pre processor commands $IFDEF, $IFNDEF
#     At this time bbcmp does not support conditional compile
#     This is an issue with opcodes.h as supplied by Ladybridge Systems (there is $IFDEF)
#     But if you regenerate opcodes.h with OPGEN, this is not included, nor can I find any reference to the
#     use of simple.modes or  secondary.modes in the source.  For our purpose we will just remove from opcodes.h
#   Also remove any trailing blank lines for source
# Pass 2:
#   Store all define symbols and values as a dictionary item in defines dictionary
#   remove $define line (or just don't add to source)
#   
# Pass 3:
#   compile the program
#
# Other design notes:
#
#  Unfortunately BCOMP makes (extreme) use of gotos.  
#  There are moudles (subs?) with multiple entry points used by gosubs
#  Breaking this down to a python function is going to be difficult to say the least.
#  One of the main uses is for error processing.  In order to keep it simple, bbcmp will simply abort when it hits
#    an error condition,  via the function error() (hopefully with enough info to point you to the problem).
#  Remember bbcmp.py is NOT intended to be used for development.  It's intent is to boot strap build a system without an original 
#    op code binary
#
#  Testing:
#  The intent is to create p-code object files that are binary identical to what BCOMP produces with the NOXREF option (bbcmp does not create the xref maps).
#  The only difference between a bbcmp.py processed source and a BCOMP should be the time date stamp of the compile.
#  Currently comparing binaries with program vbindiff
#  Also note during the development phase the source code file processed is hardcoded to:
#   /usr/local/sdsys/BP/BTEST
#  And the output p-code object is written to:
#   /usr/local/sdsys/BP.OUT/PTEST
#  Run the object with RUN BP PTEST
#  
#  Once bbcmp.py can compile BCOMP, the plan is to add argument line parsing
#

#
#
# START-DESCRIPTION:
#
# Note for GPL developers:
# This compiler uses a simple single pass approach. No doubt a clever compiler
# could produce better code but it just didn't seem worth the effort and
# experiment suggests that fancy optimisation doesn't produce the benefits
# that it does with languages where opcodes are simple actions.
# The only horrible bit is the resolution of the syntactic ambiguity of the
# < and > characters. We have been unable to find any written specification
# that sets out how these should be processed but our implementation works
# for every real program that we have tried.
#
# Adding new statements requires an entry in the STATEMENTS list and a
# corresponding entry in the ON GOSUB that uses this list.
#
# Adding a new intrinsic function requires entries in the INTRINSICS and
# INTRINSIC.OPCODES lists and a corresponding entry in that ON GOSUB.
#
# New opcodes should be defined in the C opcodes.h include file. The equivalent
# SDBasic include record is generated using the OPGEN program.
#
# The compiler uses a few internal features of SD, especially the binary tree
# variable type. We kept this type private because it is a bit weird to use
# and we thought it highly likely that we would change its implementation
# from time to time.
#
#
# Hidden variable names:
# _xxx        Direct call to subroutine xxx
# ~xxx        {xxx} object code
# __n         Temporary variable n (n is numeric)
# __name      File variable for file opened using FILE statement
# *n          Argument n to object routine. These will always end up as local
#             variables 0 upwards but must be in the symbol table
#             for the compiler to function correctly.
# *VARS       Pseudo-common for persistent variable array in object.
#
# Other special name formats:
# sss:xxx     Local variable xxx for LOCAL SUB sss
#
# Internally generated label names:
# *n          Get/Set/method routine n
#
# Defined token table
   # Data part of element is:
   #    string : 0ssssss
   #    number : 1nnnnnn
   #    matref : 2name index1 index2
   #    char(n): 3n
   #    var    : 4name
   #    @var   : 5name (excluding @ character)
   #    dfield : 6name fieldno subno valueno (dynamic var ref) gdw001
   # defined.tokens = btree(1, btree.keys) 
   # label.tree = btree(1, btree.keys)

    #  .

    #  .
    # 20 gosub label1  at pc 200

    #  .
    # 30 gosub label1 at pc 300
    #  .
    #  .
    # 40 label1:  at pc 400
    #
    # on definition of label1 (ie label1:)

    #    with data value = pc (program/object_code address of this reference)
    #  else (label previously defined via one of the jump emits ie emit.jump.addr)
    #    In this case the data value found in label_dict / label.btree  must be negative
    #    AND the abs value of the data value is the program/object_code address of the last reference
    #    reference to the label (ie 3 byte jump address of the last jump instr).
    #    At that address we find the program/object_code address of the next previous reference.
    #    This repeats until we find zero in the 3 byte jump address, indicating end of the "chain"

    #    emit.jump.addr:
    #      label_dict{label1} = -100 (forward jump)
    #      At pc 100 place 3 byte jump address =  0 0 0

    #    at ln 20 we again have label1 with pc = 200

    #      label_dict{label1} = -200 (forward jump)
    #      At pc 200 place 3 byte jump address =  100
    #    
    #    at ln 30 we again have label1 with pc = 300

    #      label_dict{label1} = -300 (forward jump)

    #       prev_addr_in_chain = dict{label1} * -1
    #       label_dict{label1} = 400 (actaul address of label1)
