Version 0.6.3
-----------------------
(mab) mods date tagged in source as 20240219 and 20240225 mab 
    Remove the ability to run the system in "insecure mode".
    Remove SECURITY program from GPL.BP and $secure from  gcat 
    Do not allow kernel(K$SECURE, >=0) to reset security flag. 
    
    VM - Add CHOWN function to OSPATH.
         Example:   CALL ospath(chown_parm,OS$CHOWN)
         where chown_parm is a VM separated string <owner_name> VM <group_name> VM <file_path>
         Note in version 2.6.6 OSPATH is an internal function (requires -internal at login to compile).
         Also for most OS$CHOWN operations to work, user will need to be root.

    GPL.BP/LOGIN
      No longer allow NETWORK or SERIAL connections.
      Always run in secure mode.
      Do not auto create missing user account.
      System admin will need to add user to sdusers group and create user default account ("create-account USER <username>" , see below) prior user login. 
    
      Change login behavior to:
      on command:
      sd -a<account> - if account exists, login otherwise terminate connection.
                         
      sd - if /home/sd/user_accounts/<username> exists, log to user account
            else display "Account <user> not in register" and terminate connection

      User must be member of sdusers group, if not terminate connection.      

      Note -  This changes the current behavior of logging into the account found at the current directory.
     
      Remove option to create account.
                
    Mod CREATE-ACCOUNT
      Rem was
        CREATE.ACCOUNT acc.name pathname {NO.QUERY}
      Now 
        CREATE.ACCOUNT USER <username>  {NO.QUERY} - account created in  /home/sd/user_accounts/<username>,  owner:group set to <username>:<username>
                                                     <username> must be found in sdusers group!
        CREATE.ACCOUNT GROUP acc.name  {NO.QUERY} - account created in  /home/sd/group_accounts/<acc.name>, owner:group set to root:sdusers
        CREATE.ACCOUNT OTHER acc.name pathname {NO.QUERY} - account created in pathname, owner:group set to root:sdusers
        
      User must be privileged (root) to use CREATE-ACCOUNT verb.  
   
    Mod DELETE-ACCOUNT
      User must be privileged (root) to use DELETE-ACCOUNT verb.
      
    Add to install script:
      Create  directories /home/sd/user_accounts and  /home/sd/group_accounts
      Add command to create user account in  /home/sd/user_accounts/<$tuser>   
  
    Implementing AF_UNIX sockets (and removing AF_INET). All remote connections will only be allowed via a tunnel (ssh tunnel).

    API changes:
       
        Rebrand the GPL.BP/VBSRVR to APISRVR and associated notation.

        SDConnectlocal(Account) - No Change. This connection method only works on the local system. It creates a forked process of sd and communicates via pipes,
        no network involved.

        SDConnectUDS(Account) - New connection method mostly for testing. This is still a local system connection only,
        but connects via the Unix Domain Socket /tmp/sdsys/sdclient.socket. Connection method connects as initiating local user (the peer).

        SDConnect(Host,Port,UserName,Password,Account) - Connect from remote via ssh tunnel.

        If configuration file has APILOGIN=1 or not found:  User and Password are validated, API server process runs with usr_id and grp_id as UserName
       (remember all server connections start out as root).

        If APILOGIN=0:  UserName and Password are NOT validated, API server process runs with usr_id and grp_id as the User creating the ssh tunnel (peer)
        User still must be a valid linux user. 
 
        Regardless of connection method, User MUST be member of sdusers group!
    
    Update MESSAGES file, change references from SCARLETDME  to String Database (sd)

    Remove hold over users in $LOGINS
    
    NOTE!! In order for this rev to build, libbsd-dev must be installed (sudo apt-get install libbsd-dev)
    
(mab) Create separate revision numbers for both the Virtual Machine and SD (defined in gplsrc/revstamp.h). 
(mab) Add to SYSLOG sd command line.
(dsm) Created Depreciated directory for features that have been removed or modified from original function.
      GPL.BP.zip contains code fore removed features.  
      SD.VOCLIB.zip contains LISTxx code for 80x24 screen size.

Version 0.6.2 1/21/2024
-----------------------
(mab) Corrected issues with C code that were generating errors during make
(dsm) Updated GPL.BP CONFIG to use 'less' to display the licence file
(dsm) Updated all sentences in SD.VOCLIB for larger terminal display
(dsm) Added a globally cataloged shell for the micro console based editor
(mab) Replaced hard coded hex valuss in GPL.BP with @VM and other hex alternatives
(mab) Fixed possible endless loop in DELETE-FILE

Version 0.6.1 1/19/2024
-----------------------
- Removed COPYP and PROC functionality
- Removed reference to the openqm website which no longer exists
  in all code.
- Removed history entries from parent databases
- Changed the install scripts to
  - wait until after installation to /usr/local/sdsys to recompile c code
  - avoid starting SD during installation or compile Basic code
- Modified SD.VOCLIB to be a directory file
- Set up a pcloud directory to hold zip file of each release

Prior to 1/19/2024
------------------
SD, the String Database is based on code originally released under the
GPL license in 2007 as a GPL release of the OpenQM database. Later
on, that code was forked and modified. The result became the ScarletDME
database.  It was a 32 bit only database until 2022 when the first
iteration of the 64 bit version was released.

SD is based on the 64 bit code in the geneb/ScarletDME github repository
as of the end of 2023.

2024-01-15 In creating SD the following changes have been made:

Some features have been removed. These include :
1 the Big Letter capability for large print titles on printed reports
  and terminal displays.
2 The package capability that allowed for installation of third party
  packages in the original commercial product.
3 TAPE related packages that included the account and file save and
  restore features.
4  PROC capability
5 COPYP functionality (COPY using Pick syntax).

The SD_SHM_KEY and SD_SEM_KEY offsets have been changed so that SD
can be run in parallel with commercial and open source databases that
use the same underlying architecture.

The sockets used for the API and telnet access have been changed:
	The telnet socket from 4242 to 4244
	The API socket from 4243 to 4245
	
The original database was called OpenQM and is still available as a
commercial product from Rocket Software.  For SD, the original QM
branding has been entirely removed.  Even internal variables and program
and file names have been changed to reflect the SD branding.

Some references to ScarletDME and Ladybridge Software have been
removed.  Copyright statements have been retained.

The default location of the database has been changed to
/usr/local/sdsys.

The default terminal type is Linux and the default terminal size is 120x36.

The C and Basic object code is included in the download.  To install without
recompiling everything, comment out the Make -B command and the two
lines  containing FIRST.COMPILE and SECOND.COMPILE respectively.

This database is in development. So far everything I have tested seems to
work as expected. However, I'm sure there are things that need to
be found and corrected. Other testers are appreciated.
