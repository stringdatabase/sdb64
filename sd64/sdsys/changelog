    SD, the Multivalue String Database

Change Log:
-----------------------
Version 0.9.0
-------------
(d-chou) Change to sdsem.c - LockSemaphore() add IPC_NOWAIT and RelinquishTimeslice
  Semaphores can be used to create exclusive locks, preventing multiple processes from accessing a shared resource at the same time.
  However, if the IPC_NOWAIT constant is not specified, a process trying to acquire the lock will block and wait if the semaphore is already held by another process.
  This can lead to unintended synchronization between processes. To avoid this, IPC_NOWAIT should be specified, which will cause the process to return immediately with an error if the lock cannot be acquired. 

(mab) Convert sd dynamic file blobs prefix from '~' to '%'
      
  Turn function "process_file" back on in sdfix. For some reason it was commented out (sdfix did nothing).

  Fix directory file name mapping of '~' and '%t'
  
  The BASIC command SSELECT is processed by pcode routine _SSELCT, when it attempts to sort the NULL id, the wheels come off (seg fault).
    Correct op_sort.c  / op_sortdata() to test for a NULL id before processing (prevent segfault on strlen() function.
  
  Add SYS$ keys in KEYS.H (see op_sys.c) for BASIC function system() (prep for qmExplorer)
  
  Add subroutines EUID_SET and EUID_RESTORE to set and restore the euid and egid of the process running sd.
      If a process is started with sudo sd, the process will be dropped to runing as sdsys and only run as root (euid = 0) 
      when necessary.  This switch is all performed in CPROC with the dynamic array privileged_commands defining the commands
      that require root privileges.
      
  special note:      At install we cannot reduce running privialges to sdsys, none of the groups are effective
                      casuing all sorts for access issues.  To get around this CPROC must be complied with
                      IS_INSTALL defined.  This define statement will be found in GPL.BP file "define_install.h"
                      The install script overwrites this file with IS_INSTALL commented out, and CPROC will be
                      recomplied.
        
  Modify how group accounts are setup / handled (CREATE.ACCOUNT).
  Group accounts now have their parent directory ownership starting as sdsys : group
  To access a group account, a user must belong to the linux group of the same name (LOGIN / LOGTO) 
  CREATE.ACCOUNT will create the linux group (if it does not exist) and add "sdsys" and "root" to members.
  CREATE.ACCOUNT sets the setgid bit on the account's parent directory.   This allows the directories / files 
    to be modified by all the users who are part of the group of the parent directory.
  CREATE,ACCOUNT saves group name in fld 3 of ACCOUNTS record (for both CREATE.ACCOUNT USER and GROUP)
  LOGIN and LOGTO(CPROC) now checks to confirm user is a member of sdusers group and ACCOUNT group
    mod to function is_grp_member(user,group) to return true if group found or if group = user

  Add command MODIFY.ACCOUNT to add users as members to the sd account.
  
  Add command WHO.AM.I to display information on the current user and process.

  Tighten up sdsys file permissions (only allow group to have write access on necessary directories / files).
    Install script sets  /usr/local/sdsys owner : group  sdsys : sduser with permissions 755
    except:
     775 /usr/local/sdsys/ errlog
     654 /usr/local/sdsys/ACCOUNTS/SDSYS

  Remove the ability to set "PICK" compatibility options via the OPTION program:
  PICK.BREAKPOINT    : Off   Pick syntax for BREAK.ON and BREAK.SUP
  PICK.BREAKPOINT.U  : Off   Handle U breakpoint option in Pick manner
  PICK.EXPLODE       : Off   Pick style processing of single value item in BY.EXP
  PICK.GRAND.TOTAL   : Off   GRAND.TOTAL text on same line as values
  PICK.IMPLIED.EQ    : Off   Implied EQ between field and literal in query
  PICK.NULL          : Off   Return null for null data in ML, MR and FMT()
  PICK.WILDCARD      : Off   Allow use of Pick style wildcards in queries
  QUALIFIED.DISPLAY  : Off   Allow Pick style qualified display clauses

  Note: at this time the source still contains the code to implement these options,
     but the intent is to not continue supporting "PICK" compatibility.

  Modify the GPL.BP/CATALOG program to:
     require admin priviliges for global catalog   
     set owner : group to sdsys : sdusers on write to gcat

  Install script:
     - If make fails, exit script
     - If modify script to use whatever version of python is installed.
     - add root to sdsys group.
     - update install ACCOUNTS/SDSYS record to include group name sdsys
  Delete Script:
   - Remove group sdsys on sd delete

  MakeFile:
      Builds embedded python
  
      Move "Embedded Python" code from examples to gplsrc and GPL.BP 

      BCOMP - allow @FILE.NAME on left side of assignment.

      VOC / NEWVOC add SD.ACCOUNTS q pointer to SDSYS/ACCOUNTS	  

Version 0.8.1
-------------
(mab) Correct c function op_dtx / BASIC function DTX(), using wrong format code.
(mab) Add GPL.BP subs !SD_GET_SALT and !SD_KEY_FROM_PW. Routines use SDEXT to create SALT
      and Key from Password (Phrase) via Libsodium.  See SD Encryption in Documentation folder. 
(mab) Add embedded python build to examples folder (../examples/python/embedded_python). See  
      SD Embedded Python in Documentation folder.

Version 0.7.1
-------------
(mab) Add BASIC Functions / Statements:
      SDENCRYPT / SDDECRYPT
	  SDEXT – Generic function for extending SD / BASIC to interface with C Functions.
(mab) Remove unsupported BASIC Functions / Statements:
      ABORTE, ABORTM
      CONNECT.PORT, ERRMSG, TTYGET, TTYSET, STOPE, STOPM 
      ENCRYPT, DECRYPT - replace with SDENCRYTP, SDDECRYPT
      ENTER.PACKAGE, EXIT.PACKAGE, PACKAGE, PROCREAD, PROCWRITE,
	  TRACE
      PICK.ERRMSG compiler mode
      Remove associated references from gplsrc/opcodes.h
      Remove code from gplsrc as necessary
(dsm) Removed compiled code in fld 16 of I type dictionary items that are copied from
FILES_DICTS. Created a Record in VOC, THIRD.COMPILE that recompiles them afterthey are 
copied.  Updated install scripts to call THIRD.COMPILE.
(dsm) Added SED and UPDATE.RECORD back after modifying them to not call tty routines as
the tty functionality has been removed.       
(dsm) Documentation: added a LibreOffice spreadsheet showing the VOC items that have 
been retained and removed compared to ScarletDME
(dsm) Documentation: added a LibreOffice document regarding installation.
(dsm) Have started modifying @ dictionary records and related dictionary items so that
default LIST reports are formatted for 120x36 terminal size.
(mab) Introduce max string error checking in SD.
      History: The original QM code that SD is based on was (is?) a 32 bit virtual machine. As such
	  strings are limited in size to just under 2 GB.  The issue is there is no size checking and a
	  user could attempt to create or load a string at or above this limit, causing SD to crash (segfault).
	  Changes to date:
	    sdclilib client will not allow user to write a record > MAX_STRING_SIZE
		Directory read of a file (record) > MAX_STRING_SIZE not allowed.
        Functions: append (':='), CHANGE(), concatenate (':'), INSERT(), REPLACE(), STR()
         will not allow a string > MAX_STRING_SIZE to be created.		
		
(dsm) Change max string size to 1 GB
 

Version 0.7.0
-------------
(mab) Created a BASIC compiler (written in Python) for SD, we now have a version of SD 
that has no binary elements required for installation.  Everything is source and auditable.  
During installation the Python basic compiler compiles the necessary source code in GPL.BP
hat in the past prevented the system from being binary element free.
Also, any required dynamic dictionaries are created during installation.

Version 0.6.4
-------------
(mab) sd command as privileged user (sudo sd) will start out in account SDSYS  
(mab) Only allow non privileged user to LOGIN or LOGTO:
      Their own account.
      Group account which they have access to.
         A list of allowed users is found in ACCOUNTS record, field <ACC$USERS>
	 CREATE-ACCOUNT USER adds user to their own account list.
	 Use the MODIFY command ie) "MODIFY ACCOUNTS <account name>" to edit user list for now.
(mab) Change install script template of ACCOUNTS / SDSYS file to ownership from  
        -rwxrwxr-x 1 sdsys sdusers
      To
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 root  root 
(mab) LIST-USERS now reports for user: Last Login Account, Time and Date        
(dsm) Removed MED from GPL.BP, GPL.BP.OUT, gcat, NEWVOC & VOC
      Moved GPL.BP/MED source code to Depreciated
(dsm) Removed SED from GPL.BP, GPL.BP.OUT, gcat, NEWVOC & VOC
      Moved GPL.BP/SED source code to Depreciated

      Moved GPL.BP/ADMUSER source code to Depreciated
      Removed GPL.BP/$ADMUSER.SCR
(dsm) Removed files $FORMS, $SCREENS, $SCREENS.DIC, ERRMSG, ERRMSG.DIC
      Remove ERRMSG in VOC and NEWVOC 
(dsm) Remove GPL.BP SP.ASSIGN & SET.QUEUE progrrams from GPL.BP, GPL.BP.OUT, gcat, NEWVOC & VOC
      Move GPL.BP/SP.ASSIGN and SET.QUEUE to Depreceiated
(dsm) Delete all records in MESSAGES starting with PL (Polish)
(dsm) Removed system verbs ADMSRVR CREATE-USER, DELETE-USER, LIST-USERS, RECOVER-USERS and
      related files if VOC, NEWVOC, GPL.BP, GPL.BP.OUT and gcat


Version 0.6.3
-----------------------
(mab) mods date tagged in source as 20240219 and 20240225 mab 
    Remove the ability to run the system in "insecure mode".
    Remove SECURITY program from GPL.BP and $secure from  gcat 
    Do not allow kernel(K$SECURE, >=0) to reset security flag. 
    
    VM - Add CHOWN function to OSPATH.
         Example:   CALL ospath(chown_parm,OS$CHOWN)
         where chown_parm is a VM separated string <owner_name> VM <group_name> VM <file_path>
         Note in version 2.6.6 OSPATH is an internal function (requires -internal at login to compile).
         Also for most OS$CHOWN operations to work, user will need to be root.

    GPL.BP/LOGIN
      No longer allow NETWORK or SERIAL connections.
      Always run in secure mode.
      Do not auto create missing user account.
      System admin will need to add user to sdusers group and create user default account ("create-account USER <username>" , see below) prior user login. 
    
      Change login behavior to:
      on command:
      sd -a<account> - if account exists, login otherwise terminate connection.
                         
      sd - if /home/sd/user_accounts/<username> exists, log to user account
            else display "Account <user> not in register" and terminate connection

      User must be member of sdusers group, if not terminate connection.      

      Note -  This changes the current behavior of logging into the account found at the current directory.
     
      Remove option to create account.
                
    Mod CREATE-ACCOUNT
      Rem was
        CREATE.ACCOUNT acc.name pathname {NO.QUERY}
      Now 
        CREATE.ACCOUNT USER <username>  {NO.QUERY} - account created in  /home/sd/user_accounts/<username>,  owner:group set to <username>:<username>
                                                     <username> must be found in sdusers group!
        CREATE.ACCOUNT GROUP acc.name  {NO.QUERY} - account created in  /home/sd/group_accounts/<acc.name>, owner:group set to root:sdusers
        CREATE.ACCOUNT OTHER acc.name pathname {NO.QUERY} - account created in pathname, owner:group set to root:sdusers
        
      User must be privileged (root) to use CREATE-ACCOUNT verb.  
   
    Mod DELETE-ACCOUNT
      User must be privileged (root) to use DELETE-ACCOUNT verb.
      
    Add to install script:
      Create  directories /home/sd/user_accounts and  /home/sd/group_accounts
      Add command to create user account in  /home/sd/user_accounts/<$tuser>   
  
    Implementing AF_UNIX sockets (and removing AF_INET). All remote connections will only be allowed via a tunnel (ssh tunnel).

    API changes:
       
        Rebrand the GPL.BP/VBSRVR to APISRVR and associated notation.

        SDConnectlocal(Account) - No Change. This connection method only works on the local system. It creates a forked process of sd and communicates via pipes,
        no network involved.

        SDConnectUDS(Account) - New connection method mostly for testing. This is still a local system connection only,
        but connects via the Unix Domain Socket /tmp/sdsys/sdclient.socket. Connection method connects as initiating local user (the peer).

        SDConnect(Host,Port,UserName,Password,Account) - Connect from remote via ssh tunnel.

        If configuration file has APILOGIN=1 or not found:  User and Password are validated, API server process runs with usr_id and grp_id as UserName
       (remember all server connections start out as root).

        If APILOGIN=0:  UserName and Password are NOT validated, API server process runs with usr_id and grp_id as the User creating the ssh tunnel (peer)
        User still must be a valid linux user. 
 
        Regardless of connection method, User MUST be member of sdusers group!
    
    Update MESSAGES file, change references from SCARLETDME  to String Database (sd)

    Remove hold over users in $LOGINS
    
    NOTE!! In order for this rev to build, libbsd-dev must be installed (sudo apt-get install libbsd-dev)
    
(mab) Create separate revision numbers for both the Virtual Machine and SD (defined in gplsrc/revstamp.h). 
(mab) Add to SYSLOG sd command line.
(dsm) Created Depreciated directory for features that have been removed or modified from original function.
      GPL.BP.zip contains code fore removed features.  
      SD.VOCLIB.zip contains LISTxx code for 80x24 screen size.

Version 0.6.2 1/21/2024
-----------------------
(mab) Corrected issues with C code that were generating errors during make
(dsm) Updated GPL.BP CONFIG to use 'less' to display the licence file
(dsm) Updated all sentences in SD.VOCLIB for larger terminal display
(dsm) Added a globally cataloged shell for the micro console based editor
(mab) Replaced hard coded hex valuss in GPL.BP with @VM and other hex alternatives
(mab) Fixed possible endless loop in DELETE-FILE

Version 0.6.1 1/19/2024
-----------------------
- Removed COPYP and PROC functionality
- Removed reference to the openqm website which no longer exists
  in all code.
- Removed history entries from parent databases
- Changed the install scripts to
  - wait until after installation to /usr/local/sdsys to recompile c code
  - avoid starting SD during installation or compile Basic code
- Modified SD.VOCLIB to be a directory file
- Set up a pcloud directory to hold zip file of each release

Prior to 1/19/2024
------------------
SD, the String Database is based on code originally released under the
GPL license in 2007 as a GPL release of the OpenQM database. Later
on, that code was forked and modified. The result became the ScarletDME
database.  It was a 32 bit only database until 2022 when the first
iteration of the 64 bit version was released.

SD is based on the 64 bit code in the geneb/ScarletDME github repository
as of the end of 2023.

2024-01-15 In creating SD the following changes have been made:

Some features have been removed. These include :
1 the Big Letter capability for large print titles on printed reports
  and terminal displays.
2 The package capability that allowed for installation of third party
  packages in the original commercial product.
3 TAPE related packages that included the account and file save and
  restore features.
4  PROC capability
5 COPYP functionality (COPY using Pick syntax).

The SD_SHM_KEY and SD_SEM_KEY offsets have been changed so that SD
can be run in parallel with commercial and open source databases that
use the same underlying architecture.

The sockets used for the API and telnet access have been changed:
	The telnet socket from 4242 to 4244
	The API socket from 4243 to 4245
	
The original database was called OpenQM and is still available as a
commercial product from Rocket Software.  For SD, the original QM
branding has been entirely removed.  Even internal variables and program
and file names have been changed to reflect the SD branding.

Some references to ScarletDME and Ladybridge Software have been
removed.  Copyright statements have been retained.

The default location of the database has been changed to
/usr/local/sdsys.

The default terminal type is Linux and the default terminal size is 120x36.

The C and Basic object code is included in the download.  To install without
recompiling everything, comment out the Make -B command and the two
lines  containing FIRST.COMPILE and SECOND.COMPILE respectively.

This database is in development. So far everything I have tested seems to
work as expected. However, I'm sure there are things that need to
be found and corrected. Other testers are appreciated.
